# discord_rpc_rust
Discord Rich Presence Library written in Rust

# Tested on windows
I _believe_ that cross-platform compiling works. However, running `cargo test` results in linker errors on linux so for now I haven't tested on that OS. If you have that issue and find a way to fix it, let me know :)
That said, I'll probably work on a fix for that issue a bit later. If you'd like to see my plans please view the project: https://github.com/HazardDev/discord_rpc_rust/projects/1
